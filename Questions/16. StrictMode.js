// Strict mode in JavaScript is a way to enforce stricter parsing and error handling to catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions

// Advantages
// 1. Prevents accidental globals by throwing errors on undeclared variables.
// 2. Disallows duplicate parameter names and other unsafe syntax.
// 3. Makes debugging easier by converting silent errors into throw errors.
