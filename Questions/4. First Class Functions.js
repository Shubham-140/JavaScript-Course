// What are first class functions?

// A first-class function in JavaScript is a function that is treated as a value. This means you can assign it to variables, pass it as arguments to other functions, return it from functions, and store it in data structures

// Arrow functions are a great example of first class functions

// eg

const sum=(a, b)=>{
    return a+b;
}

console.log(sum(3, 6));
